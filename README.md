# Chelsea-FC-Updated


Programming language: python

Adapted from provided skeleton work, with solution coded in solve.py.

Note that the actual solution function I used to generate the outputs is solve_not_naive. The function solve_not_naive_randomized, which has been commented out, is a trial solution that I haven't finished debugging with.

To run one single input: run:

    python3 solve.py case.in --solver=clever case.out

To run on all inputs: run (in the parent directory of "python" directory that also contains the inputs):

    python3 python/solve_all.py inputs outputs

Note that in solve_all, the solution function to use has been set to solve_not_naive
